Application compile process:
modify CMakeLists:
    set(SDK_PATH "/opt/sdk/aarch64-buildroot-linux-gnu_sdk-buildroot")
    to your own sdk path
Local compile:
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
Cross compile:(modify cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE to your own SDK path)
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/opt/sdk/aarch64-buildroot-linux-gnu_sdk-buildroot/share/buildroot/toolchainfile.cmake ..
    make
Clean:
    go to project folder, clean current build status:
        make clean              
    clean all build files:
        make distclean
